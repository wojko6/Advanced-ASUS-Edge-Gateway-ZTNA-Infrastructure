# Roadmap

## Phase 2 — dedicated x86 edge

- OPNsense on supported x86 hardware.
- VLAN 10 (trusted LAN), VLAN 20 (IoT), VLAN 30 (lab), and a management VLAN.
- Explicit inter-VLAN default deny and documented service exceptions.
- Configuration backup/restore drill and UPS-aware shutdown.

## Phase 3 — detection and response

- Suricata IDS first, IPS only after false-positive baselining.
- Wazuh agents/collector, indexer, dashboards, alert routing, and retention policy.
- TLS log transport with a managed CA and monitored delivery queue.
- Attack simulations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and retained evidence.

## Phase 4 — engineering maturity

- Metrics for DNS latency/cache, VPN throughput, drops, CPU, RAM, temperature, and storage wear.
- Golden configuration, reproducible restore, and quarterly recovery exercises.
- Policy-as-code validation for Tailscale and OPNsense changes.
- Hardware/ISP failure tests, measured RTO/RPO, and a documented incident runbook.

The ASUS router can remain an access point or isolated secondary lab node after enforcement moves to OPNsense.
